    <h1>Welcome To The Beach</h1>
    <p>The Jersey Shore is the coastal region of the U.S. state of New Jersey.
      Geographically, the term encompasses about 141 miles of oceanfront bordering the Atlantic Ocean, from
      Keyport in the north to Cape May Point in the south. </p>

    <p>Famous for its wide beaches, many boardwalks with arcades, amusement parks, and water parks, the Jersey Shore is
      a popular vacation spot with residents of North Jersey, New York, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, and
      Pennsylvania. Certain shore communities are also popular with visitors of the Canadian province of Quebec. Due to
      New Jersey's peninsular geography, both sunrise and sunset are visible over water from different points on the
      Jersey Shore.</p>

    <p>Hurricane Sandy in 2012 devastated much of the northern part of the region, spawning the demolition and
      rebuilding of entire neighborhoods, with reinvention on a physically and financially elevated, and economically
      upscale level; this process of gentrification is rapidly escalating property values and transforming many
      communities on the Jersey Shore into a second home for the New York financial community, akin to the more
      established Gold Coast and Hamptons on Long Island.</p>

      The Jersey Shore is lined with over 40 different towns and communities, each with a different character, flavor,
      and vibe.
    </div>
    <div class="box-2">
      Many towns cater extensively to summer tourists, while others are increasingly or completely full-year residential
      communities.

      Most ocean beaches in New Jersey charge admission to the beaches through the use of beach tags. Ocean beaches in
      New Jersey that do not use beach tags include Atlantic City, Strathmere (Upper Township), North Wildwood,
      Wildwood, and Wildwood Crest.
